# Hybrid Infrastructure Health Monitoring

[![HCS Standards](https://img.shields.io/badge/standards-HCS-0078D4)](https://platform.hybridsolutions.cloud/standards/)

> SCOM and Azure Monitor health models for **Hyper-V and Azure Local**.

This repository defines infrastructure health as an entity model with signals, state, rollup,
alerts, customization, and lifecycle—not merely a list of metric thresholds.

## Platform tracks

| Platform | SCOM Management Pack | Azure Monitor Health Models |
|---|---|---|
| **Azure Local** | Committed | Committed |
| **Hyper-V** | Committed | Constrained development through Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM and Arc-enabled Servers |

The platforms share SCOM authoring patterns and health semantics where appropriate. Their topology,
discoveries, signals, prerequisites, support matrices, and release boundaries remain explicit.

## Prerequisites

To preview or contribute to the documentation, install:

- Git;
- Node.js 20; and
- PowerShell 7 or later.

Product implementation prerequisites are documented per platform and delivery surface. A functional
development baseline is not a production release until its platform-specific certification gates
pass.

## Documentation

The `docs/` folder is a [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) site published at
<https://labs.hybridsolutions.cloud/hybrid-health-monitoring/>. It includes:

- separate [Azure Local](docs/azure-local/index.md) and [Hyper-V](docs/hyper-v/index.md) entry points;
- the shared health-model design, signal catalog, and Architecture Decision Records;
- Azure Local SCOM and Azure Monitor implementation guidance;
- the implemented Hyper-V SCOM Management Pack development baseline;
- the constrained Hyper-V Azure Monitor path through Arc-enabled SCVMM and Arc-enabled hosts; and
- an Azure DevOps-backed [roadmap](docs/project/roadmap.md) and [implementation plan](PLAN.md).

```powershell

## Delivery hierarchy

- Azure Local monitoring
  - Azure Local SCOM Management Pack
  - Azure Local Azure Monitor Health Models
- Hyper-V monitoring
  - Hyper-V SCOM Management Pack
  - Hyper-V Azure Monitor through Arc-enabled SCVMM — conditional

Research and implementation Stories are linked in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

The [source tree](src/README.md) is platform first and solution second. Azure Local and Hyper-V each
own separate `scom-mp/` and `azure-monitor/` roots. Accepted
[ADR 0030](docs/design/decisions/0030-platform-first-source-tree.md) defines the layout; accepted
ADR 0022 prohibits shared SCOM runtime elements.

## Current status

- The Azure Local SCOM design, research catalog, deterministic source build, DA, monitoring,
  presentation, reporting, and customer override baseline are implemented.
- The platform-first roadmap and Azure DevOps hierarchy are established.
- Hyper-V Private Cloud Monitoring `1.0.7.0` is implemented and repository-published as 13
  permanently sealed product MPs: four always-required MPs and nine optional capability MPs.
  The deployment ZIP upgrades all 12 non-PureStorage solution MPs together; Pure Storage remains a
  separate vendor-dependent adapter. Management Packs use the product-named `HyperVPrivateCloud.*` namespace.
  The primary deployment ZIP upgrades all 12 non-PureStorage solution packs together; SCOM runtime
  and lifecycle certification follows operator installation.
- The Azure Local five-project SCOM suite passes Microsoft VSAE/SDK verification and ordered test
  sealing but remains under development and is a separate product from the Hyper-V download.
- Independent Azure Local Azure Monitor Health Model development baselines
  compile with Bicep; live API, identity, telemetry, fault, cost, and teardown evidence remains.
- The optional SCOM-to-ServiceNow integration uses ServiceNow's existing SCOM Events connector. It
  has separate product allow-list profiles, a mapping contract, administration guidance, and
  passing offline validation; Windows MID Server configuration and live connector proof remain.
