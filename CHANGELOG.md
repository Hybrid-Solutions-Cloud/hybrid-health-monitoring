# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

* Move the project to `Hybrid-Solutions-Cloud/hybrid-health-monitoring` and publish documentation
  at `https://labs.hybridsolutions.cloud/hybrid-health-monitoring/`.

### Changed

* Run every Hyper-V Private Cloud v2 first-party script through public SCOM command-executor
  wrappers that launch the machine-wide PowerShell 7 MSI path explicitly; add operator-visible
  runtime evidence, the common installation prerequisite, static contract tests, and ADR 0047.
* Correct both SCOM Distributed Application component class bases to the verified Service Designer
  `ServiceComponentGroup` type and run SDK verification through Visual Studio 2022's
  full-framework VSAE host.
* Remove SCOM expression-namespace collisions from both discovery scripts, correct MAML knowledge
  sections and three-state health mappings, and test-seal both complete five-MP dependency chains.
* Split the Design and platform sidebars into four solution-owned navigation groups so Azure Local
  and Hyper-V SCOM designs are visibly separate from their Azure Monitor Health Models designs.
* Expose solution-owned SquaredUp Dashboard Server and SquaredUp Cloud documentation in the
  sidebars and add the missing Hyper-V placeholders.
* Clarify that Migration means on-premises SCOM monitoring to Azure Monitor Health Models rather
  than workload or platform migration.
* Remove internal work-item identifiers and direct board links from public documentation and
  repository Markdown.
* Migrate the documentation site and deployment pipelines from MkDocs to VitePress while preserving the project logo, banner, and favicon.
* Rename the public site to Hybrid Infrastructure Health Monitoring and organize it by Azure Local and Hyper-V platform tracks.
* Replace the phase-only roadmap with Azure DevOps-backed platform Epics, delivery Features, research spikes, and architecture gates.

### Added

* Add the governed Hyper-V v2 sealing and release-package path: Microsoft VSAE `SealMp`, permanent
  identity and runtime-evidence gates, compatible dependency preflight, 13 individual sealed MP
  assets, 66 import-ready public override MPs, core/complete/override and 11 profile bundles,
  publisher `.mpb` identity/Authenticode inspection and transitive VSAE dependency remapping, publisher dependency
  provenance, manifests, SHA-256 checksums, an independent validator, tests, and proposed ADR 0048.
* Add the protected Hyper-V v2 production-release workflow and public runbook: Azure OIDC retrieves
  the permanent key from Key Vault only into runner temp, Release-mode eligibility is enforced,
  exact assets are retained, existing releases cannot be overwritten, and stable latest-download
  URLs are verified after publication.
* Add a read-only SCOM management-group certification collector and core standalone expectation.
  It verifies imported identities, overrides, topology, workflow and view inventory, Distributed
  Application presence, and recent HealthService diagnostic evidence while keeping destructive and
  lifecycle gates explicitly pending for human-reviewed labs.
* Add the Hyper-V Private Cloud Monitoring v2 override system: 11 composable deployment profiles,
  Lab/Standard/Strict tiers, 66 generated Discovery/Monitoring examples, explicit workflow and
  context schema, independent customer/product versions, same-MP group targeting, semantic and
  drift tests, cookdown checks, invalid-profile rejection, and Microsoft VSAE verification.
* Add the Hyper-V v2 VMM 2025 capability against the exact shipped Microsoft VMM MP identities,
  with a VMM-fabric Distributed Application root, exact server/host/cloud relationships, missing
  logical-network and network-site projections, read-only failed-job monitoring, targeted service
  rollups, 20 console views, dependency evidence, operator guidance, tests, and ADR 0046.

* Add a preview-gated Azure Local Azure Monitor Health Model baseline with Bicep-defined identity,
  entities, relationships, documented platform metric signals, state alerts, development
  parameters, research KQL, a starter workbook, contract validation, research, and ADR 0036.
* Accept a constrained Hyper-V Azure Monitor go and add an independent Bicep-compiling Health Model
  baseline with Arc-enabled SCVMM inventory, Arc-enabled host entities, Windows DCR, heartbeat,
  hypervisor CPU, cluster-event and telemetry-coverage signals, state alerts, research KQL,
  workbook, contract validation, and ADR 0037.
* Add the SCOM-to-ServiceNow development integration with separate Azure Local and Hyper-V
  connector profiles, an event/identity/lifecycle mapping contract, offline validation against both
  authored MPs, public administration guidance, and ADR 0038. The integration configures
  ServiceNow's existing SCOM Events connector; live MID Server certification remains.
* Implement the functional Azure Local SCOM MP baseline as five independent artifacts with 17
  classes, 28 relationships, staged discovery, a six-branch Distributed Application, 14 unit
  monitors, six domain aggregates, 12 dependency rollups, curated alerts, performance and event
  rules, diagnostics, operational knowledge, and 14 operator views.
* Add separate Azure Local Discovery and Monitoring override MPs, provisional Lab, Standard, and
  Strict starter templates, deterministic contract and Pester tests, SDK verification tooling, an
  administration guide, and release-gate documentation.
* Add Azure Local SCOM research, monitoring catalog, architecture, package, class, workflow,
  health, tuning, and validation documentation with editable draw.io sources and published SVGs.
* Accept ADRs 0032–0035 for the Azure Local local-runtime boundary, MP decomposition, object and DA
  architecture, and health/alert/rollup contract.
* Add separate customer-owned Hyper-V Discovery and Monitoring override contracts, optional Lab,
  Standard, and Strict starter templates, and a public Management Pack administration guide.
* Implement the functional Hyper-V MP development baseline with 13 classes, 20 relationships,
  staged discovery, a platform-owned Distributed Application, 9 health monitors, 10 dependency
  rollups, 12 performance rules, 4 event-alert rules, operational knowledge, a diagnostic task,
  and 10 operator views.
* Add deterministic build and contract checks, Microsoft SDK verification tooling, complete public
  element localization, and Pester coverage for topology, workflows, views, and product boundaries.
* Generate separate customer-owned Hyper-V Discovery and Monitoring override MPs for Lab,
  Standard, and Strict starter profiles, and accept ADRs 0027–0029 and 0031.
* Add a ServiceNow integration roadmap covering separate SCOM and Azure Monitor paths, secure
  webhook modernization, dual-source authority, research gates, and proof-of-concept outcomes.
* Add the committed Hyper-V SCOM Management Pack track and conditional Azure Monitor track through Arc-enabled SCVMM.
* Add ADRs 0021–0023 for the platform split, SCOM packaging boundary, and Hyper-V Azure Monitor go/no-go gate.
* Add the phase-one Hyper-V SCOM monitoring research plan, exhaustive inventory schema, threshold
  policy, and bounded research spikes.
* Treat Network ATC as the preferred baseline for eligible Windows Server 2025 Datacenter Hyper-V
  clusters, with separate manual and SCVMM/SDN-managed networking paths.
* Define the Microsoft Hyper-V 2019 Management Pack as research evidence only, with no import,
  extension, override, or runtime dependency in the new Hyper-V MP.
* Split the design documentation into explicit Azure Local and Hyper-V platform sections, each
  separated into SCOM and Azure Monitor design lanes.
* Add ADR 0025 for Hyper-V network-management authority and the Network ATC, SCVMM/SDN, and manual
  networking variants.
* Accept ADR 0022 with completely independent Azure Local and Hyper-V SCOM runtime packaging.
* Add ADR 0026 plus explicit Azure Local and Hyper-V Distributed Application design contracts,
  implementation tasks, dynamic membership, rollup, views, reports, dashboards,
  SLO targets, and validation requirements.
* Add the comprehensive Hyper-V SCOM architecture set with Vue-rendered component, class,
  sequence, state, dependency, discovery, alert, security, test, and release diagrams.
* Propose ADRs 0027–0029 for Hyper-V MP decomposition, object/discovery architecture, and
  evidence-driven health, alert, and DA rollup behavior.
* Restructure `src/` by Azure Local and Hyper-V platform, then SCOM and Azure Monitor solution;
  accept ADR 0030 as the source-path authority and nest optional SquaredUp artifacts by owner.
