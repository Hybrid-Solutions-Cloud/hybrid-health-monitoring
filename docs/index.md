## What this project is

This project defines production-grade health monitoring for **Hyper-V and Azure Local
infrastructure** at the health-model level, rather than treating monitoring as a collection of
unrelated metric thresholds. Planning is organized by platform first and delivery surface second.

## Health model components

Both platforms use the same health-model grammar while retaining their own supported topology:

    AzL --> AzLS["SCOM MP"]
    AzL --> AzLA["Azure Monitor"]

## Tracks at a glance

| Platform | SCOM Management Pack | Azure Monitor Health Models |
|---|---|---|
| **Azure Local** | Committed | Committed |
| **Hyper-V** | Committed | Constrained development; live validation and parity gates |

## Companion tooling

[SquaredUp DS](https://ds.squaredup.com) and [SquaredUp Cloud](https://squaredup.com) are optional
visualization layers for the SCOM and Azure Monitor tracks respectively.

[ServiceNow integration](integrations/servicenow.md) has a SCOM connector development baseline and
separate SCOM and Azure Monitor paths for Event Management, CMDB correlation, and incident workflows.

## Project status

::: info Hyper-V SCOM release available
Hyper-V Private Cloud Monitoring `1.0.4.0` is the current sealed SCOM release and is available from
the [Hyper-V download page](/downloads/hyper-v-private-cloud). Azure Local remains a development
track and has no public SCOM package. See the [project roadmap](/project/roadmap) and
[implementation plan](https://github.com/Hybrid-Solutions-Cloud/hybrid-health-monitoring/blob/main/PLAN.md)
for the remaining certification gates.
