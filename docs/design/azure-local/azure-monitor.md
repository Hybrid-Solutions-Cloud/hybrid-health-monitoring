# Azure Local Azure Monitor Health Models design

This lane applies the accepted Azure Local platform baseline to Azure Monitor Health Models. Its
cloud prerequisites and entity mappings do not apply to the conditional Hyper-V Arc-enabled SCVMM
track.

## Current status

A preview-gated development baseline is implemented and compiles with Bicep. It creates the Health
Model resource graph, managed identity authentication, deployment and domain entities,
relationships, two documented Azure Local metric signals, state alerts, development parameters,
research KQL, and a starter workbook. Subscription what-if/deployment, RBAC, live-signal, fault,
cost, and teardown validation remain release gates.

## Canonical design

| Concern | Design source |
|---|---|
| Platform entities and signal meaning | [Scope and topology](../scope-topology.md), [signal catalog](../signal-catalog.md), and [concept mapping](../concept-mapping.md) |
| Entity graph | [ADR 0006](../decisions/0006-azmon-entity-model.md) |
| Health and alert separation | [Health model](../health-model.md), [ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-health-rollup-policy.md), and [ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-alert-vs-health-state.md) |
| Cloud prerequisites | [ADR 0010](../decisions/0010-cloud-prerequisites-contract.md) and [prerequisites](../../azure-local/azure-monitor/prerequisites.md) |
| Metrics and logs | [ADR 0012](../decisions/0012-azure-monitor-workspace-vs-law-metrics.md) |
| Deployment | [ADR 0013](../decisions/0013-azmon-deployment-strategy.md) |
| Cost, scale, and retention | [ADR 0019](../decisions/0019-cost-scale-retention.md) |
| Customization and lifecycle | [Customization](../customization.md) and supporting ADRs 0007–0008 and 0014–0018 |
| Current implementation | [Architecture](azure-monitor-architecture.md), [research](../../azure-local/azure-monitor/research.md), and [ADR 0036](../decisions/0036-azure-local-azure-monitor-health-model-v1.md) |
