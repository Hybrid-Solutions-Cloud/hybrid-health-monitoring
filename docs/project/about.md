# About

`hybrid-health-monitoring` is an open-source project under the
[Hybrid Solutions Cloud](https://github.com/Hybrid-Solutions-Cloud) organization. It delivers
production-grade health monitoring for **Hyper-V and Azure Local** through SCOM and, where
supported, Azure Monitor.

The public product title is **Hybrid Infrastructure Health Monitoring**. The repository moved from
its original Azure Local-specific identity so the project name, ownership, roadmap, and published
documentation represent both platform tracks. [ADR 0024](../design/decisions/0024-repository-and-publishing-identity.md)
records the migration decision.

## Product structure

| Platform | Delivery surface | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Local | SCOM Management Pack | Committed |
| Azure Local | Azure Monitor Health Models | Committed |
| Hyper-V | SCOM Management Pack | Committed |
| Hyper-V | Azure Monitor through Arc-enabled SCVMM and Arc-enabled hosts | Constrained development baseline; live validation and parity gates |

## Project goals

1. **Model platform health, not just alerts.** Define entity topology, signals, states, rollup,
   alerting, customization, and monitoring-pipeline health.
2. **Keep platform support honest.** Reuse stable patterns without claiming Hyper-V and Azure Local
   expose identical topology or telemetry.
3. **Customize without forking.** Provide upgrade-safe SCOM overrides and parameterized Azure
   Monitor deployments.
4. **Validate before promising parity.** Use research spikes, ADRs, lab evidence, and deterministic
   tests to decide supported scope.
5. **Publish decisions and delivery status.** Keep the web documentation, delivery hierarchy,
   roadmap, and implementation plan aligned.

## Shared foundation

The two platforms share health dimensions, state semantics, rollup principles, naming patterns,
SCOM authoring conventions, test strategy, and documentation structure. Platform-specific entity
inventories, discoveries, signals, thresholds, prerequisites, and support matrices stay separate.

Whether the two SCOM products share a sealed library or only source-level patterns is deliberately
unresolved. Proposed [ADR 0022](../design/decisions/0022-scom-management-pack-packaging-boundaries.md)
owns that decision.

## Scope

### Azure Local

- physical cluster, nodes, storage, networking, and lifecycle;
- cluster-resident Azure Local platform services;
- related Azure resources and monitoring dependencies; and
- SCOM and Azure Monitor delivery surfaces.

### Hyper-V

- standalone and failover-clustered Hyper-V topology approved by research;
- optional SCVMM management context where supported; and
- an enterprise SCOM Management Pack Suite as the exclusive 100% on-premises delivery surface. Hyper-V has zero Azure Monitor or Azure Arc dependencies.

### Out of scope

- guest application monitoring;
- AKS pod or application monitoring;
- production deployment into customer environments; and
- unsupported or undocumented telemetry dependencies.

Future companion products can depend on the appropriate platform health model.
