# Architecture Decision Records

Lightweight, numbered, immutable records of architectural decisions that govern the shared
foundation plus the Azure Local and Hyper-V platform tracks.

These are project-scoped ADRs. Org-wide platform standards live in
[`AzureLocal/platform/decisions/`](https://github.com/AzureLocal/platform/tree/main/decisions).

## Design lane scope map

The early accepted ADRs were written for the Azure Local baseline. They do not automatically govern
Hyper-V simply because both products use SCOM or share health terminology.

| Design lane | Governing decisions |
|---|---|
| Shared portfolio architecture | ADRs 0020, 0021, 0024, 0030, and integration boundary ADR 0038 |
| Shared SCOM product boundaries | ADR 0022 requires independent runtime products; ADR 0026 requires platform-owned DAs |
| Azure Local platform baseline | ADRs 0001–0003, 0007–0009, and 0014–0018 |
| Azure Local SCOM | ADRs 0022, 0026, and 0032–0035 supersede or refine the earlier Azure Local SCOM baseline |
| Azure Local Azure Monitor | ADRs 0006, 0010, 0012, 0013, 0019, and current preview refinement ADR 0036 |
| Hyper-V platform and SCOM | Accepted ADRs 0022, 0025–0029, 0031, and 0039 for product boundary, network authority, DA, package, object/discovery, health/DA, authoring toolchain, and v2 external-object ownership |
| Hyper-V Azure Monitor | ADR 0023 constrained go and ADR 0037 development architecture |

Cross-cutting lifecycle ADRs can provide reusable patterns, but each platform and delivery lane
must still validate its applicable topology, dependencies, artifacts, tests, and release contract.

## When to write an ADR

- Any architectural choice that affects how the SCOM MP or Azure Monitor health model is built
- Any decision that creates a constraint on Phases 3–6
- Any cross-track parity decision
- Any decision the next maintainer would otherwise have to re-litigate

## Format

See [`template.md`](./template.md). Numbered sequentially, ZERO-padded to four digits. Filename
is `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`. Once an ADR is **Accepted** it is immutable — supersede it with a
new ADR rather than editing it in place.

## Workflow

1. Open a PR adding the ADR with status `Proposed`
2. Discuss and refine in PR review
3. Merge with status `Accepted` once consensus reached
4. If later overturned, write a successor ADR and mark this one `Superseded by ADR XXXX`
