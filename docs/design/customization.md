# Customization

All delivery surfaces are designed to be **customized without forking** the project. Every threshold,
alert, and health-rollup decision is parameterized so operators can adapt the monitoring to local
operational reality without modifying sealed MPs or canonical Bicep templates.

::: info Design-lane scope
Customization without forking is a shared product goal. The concrete MP names, override keys,
Bicep parameters, and tier defaults below are the Azure Local baseline. Hyper-V SCOM adopts its
concrete surface only after its research program; Hyper-V Azure Monitor parameters exist only after
an ADR 0023 go decision.
:::

> **First principle:** customer customizations must survive an upgrade. If the customer overrides volume free-space
> from 10% to 20% and we ship a new MP version, their override stays. This is non-negotiable for every released product.

## SCOM Management Packs

The customization pattern applies to both Azure Local and Hyper-V, but their override packs and
sealed targets are independent. [ADR 0022](decisions/0022-scom-management-pack-packaging-boundaries.md)
prohibits a shared runtime library or cross-product override dependency.

### Override pack pattern

The established Azure Local pattern uses a sealed product MP and an unsealed override pack. The
names below are the current Azure Local baseline. Hyper-V will use its own namespace, sealed MPs,
and override pack:

| MP | Sealed? | Edited by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AzureLocal.HealthModel.mp` | Yes | Project maintainers only | Classes, discoveries, monitors, rules, Distributed Application |
| `AzureLocal.HealthModel.Overrides.xml` | No | Customer | All threshold and behavior overrides; ships with sensible defaults |

This is the standard Microsoft pattern. The customer never edits the sealed MP. They edit the unsealed override pack
(or create their own sibling override pack referencing the sealed one).

### What can be overridden

Every monitor and rule in the sealed MP exposes the following override surface:

| Override type | What it controls | Typical use case |
|---|---|---|
| **Enabled/disabled** | Turn a monitor or rule on/off | Disable disk-temperature monitor in environments without sensor support |
| **Threshold parameters** | The numeric trigger value | Volume free-space threshold from 10% → 20% |
| **Interval / sync time** | How often a monitor runs | Reduce check frequency on resource-constrained nodes |
| **Alert severity / priority** | Critical vs Warning vs Information | Downgrade alerts that don't warrant on-call attention |
| **Alert auto-resolve** | Whether a state-recovery resolves the alert | Disable for compliance audit tracking |

### Override scope (from broadest to narrowest)

| Scope | Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **For all objects of class** | Applies to every instance of `AzureLocal.Cluster.Volume` | Org-wide volume free-space threshold change |
| **For a group** | Applies to a SCOM group (e.g. "Production HCI Volumes") | Different thresholds per environment |
| **For a specific object** | Applies to one named instance | A specific volume known to run hot intentionally |

### Threshold tiers (shipped in the override pack)

The override pack ships with three pre-built threshold tiers that the customer can swap by enabling
the relevant override group:

| Tier | Intent | Example: volume free-space warn / crit |
|---|---|---|
| **`Lab`** | Generous thresholds, alerts only on serious issues | 5% / 2% |
| **`Standard`** *(default)* | Production defaults aligned with MS recommendations | 15% / 10% |
| **`Strict`** | Tight thresholds for compliance-heavy environments | 25% / 15% |

Operators pick a tier by enabling its override group; per-instance fine-tuning still works on top.

### Customer override pack pattern (recommended)

Operators are encouraged to create their **own** override pack that references the project's override pack.
This keeps customer-specific tuning visible and version-controlled separately from project defaults:

```text
AzureLocal.HealthModel.mp                  ← sealed, ships from us
AzureLocal.HealthModel.Overrides.xml        ← unsealed defaults, ships from us
Contoso.AzureLocal.Overrides.xml            ← customer-authored, references our override pack
```

## Azure Monitor Health Models

This section currently applies to Azure Local. It applies to Hyper-V only if proposed
[ADR 0023](decisions/0023-hyper-v-azure-monitor-through-arc-enabled-scvmm.md) is accepted with a go decision.

### Parameterization via Bicep

The health model and signals ship as Bicep modules with explicit parameters for every customizable value:

```bicep
param volumeFreeSpaceWarningThresholdPct int = 15
param volumeFreeSpaceCriticalThresholdPct int = 10
param storageJobLatencyWarnSeconds int = 30
param storageJobLatencyCritSeconds int = 90
param arcAgentHeartbeatStaleMinutes int = 15
// ... one parameter per threshold
```

Operators consume the modules from their own deployment with a `*.bicepparam` file:

```bicep
using './main.bicep'

param volumeFreeSpaceWarningThresholdPct = 25
param volumeFreeSpaceCriticalThresholdPct = 15
// keep all other defaults
```

### Customization tiers (parallel to SCOM)

The same `Lab` / `Standard` / `Strict` tiers ship as pre-built `*.bicepparam` files:

- `params/lab.bicepparam`
- `params/standard.bicepparam` *(default)*
- `params/strict.bicepparam`

### Custom KQL signal replacement

Every KQL-driven signal (e.g., Arc agent heartbeat freshness) is exposed as a named module input. Operators
can replace any signal's KQL query with their own without modifying the upstream module.

```bicep
param customArcHeartbeatKqlOverride string = ''
// If non-empty, the signal uses this KQL instead of the canonical query.
```

### Action groups and alert routing

The module accepts an array of action group resource IDs. Operators wire up their existing PagerDuty /
ServiceNow / email lists without touching the module:

```bicep
param actionGroupIds array = [
  '/subscriptions/.../actionGroups/contoso-oncall-tier1'
  '/subscriptions/.../actionGroups/contoso-storage-team'
]
```

### Service Group scoping

Customers control which Azure Local clusters the health model applies to via the Service Group resource
ID input. One health model can scope to a single cluster, all clusters in a subscription, or a curated set.

## Cross-track parity

Both tracks expose the **same threshold names** so the same numbers carry across:

| Logical threshold | SCOM override parameter | Azure Monitor Bicep parameter |
|---|---|---|
| Volume free-space (warn) | `Volume.FreeSpace.WarnPercent` | `volumeFreeSpaceWarningThresholdPct` |
| Volume free-space (crit) | `Volume.FreeSpace.CritPercent` | `volumeFreeSpaceCriticalThresholdPct` |
| Storage job latency (warn) | `StorageJob.Latency.WarnSeconds` | `storageJobLatencyWarnSeconds` |
| Storage job latency (crit) | `StorageJob.Latency.CritSeconds` | `storageJobLatencyCritSeconds` |
| Arc agent heartbeat stale | `ArcAgent.Heartbeat.StaleMinutes` | `arcAgentHeartbeatStaleMinutes` |
| ... (one row per threshold) | ... | ... |

This parity is a hard project requirement — see ADR 0007 (naming convention) and the upcoming ADR on
customization strategy.

## Upgrade safety

| Track | Upgrade safety mechanism |
|---|---|
| **SCOM** | Sealed MP version bumps don't touch the unsealed override pack. Customer's override pack references the sealed MP by ID; SCOM's MP versioning model preserves overrides across upgrades by design. |
| **Azure Monitor** | Bicep modules are versioned. Customer's `*.bicepparam` file is owned by them — module updates can't overwrite it. Module changes that rename parameters require a major version bump and migration notes. |

## Documentation per signal

Every signal documented in [SCOM MP — Monitors](../azure-local/scom/index.md) and [Azure Monitor — Signals](../azure-local/azure-monitor/index.md)
includes:

- The shipped default threshold value
- Recommended values per environment tier (lab / standard / strict)
- Override or parameter name for each applicable delivery surface
- Whether the signal is enabled by default
- Operational impact level (Standard / Limited / Suppressed)

This is the contract between this project and the operator — nothing about thresholds is hidden in code.

## Optional: visualization layer

### SquaredUp (SCOM track)

The SCOM track is compatible with [SquaredUp](https://squaredup.com/) without any MP
changes. SquaredUp reads the SCOM SDK directly — it sees every class, health state,
performance counter, and alert the MP produces.

Three things our design does intentionally that make SquaredUp work well out of the box:

1. **`AzureLocal.*` class prefix** — consistent naming lets SquaredUp tiles target all
   Azure Local entities by prefix without per-class tile configuration.
2. **Distributed Application at the root** — SquaredUp's DA tile renders the full
   3-layer health rollup tree automatically.
3. **Alert allow-list + auto-resolve** (ADR 0009) — prevents the alert tile from being
   flooded by transient state changes that are only meaningful to the health model.

A SquaredUp dashboard pack is an **optional post-GA deliverable** — it ships as a
separate artifact after the applicable SCOM product reaches GA. See
[ADR 0008](decisions/0008-customization-strategy.md#optional-visualization-integrations)
for the design constraints that enable it.
