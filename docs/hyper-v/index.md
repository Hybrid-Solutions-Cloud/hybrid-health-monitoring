# Hyper-V

Hyper-V is a separate platform track. Its primary delivery is a SCOM Management Pack. Azure
Monitor now has a constrained development path for environments that use Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM
and Arc-enable each participating Hyper-V host for AMA/DCR telemetry.

| Delivery surface | Commitment | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **SCOM Management Pack** | Committed platform track | Version 1.0.2.0 permanently sealed, offline verified, and repository-published; operator SCOM certification follows installation |
| **Azure Monitor through Arc-enabled SCVMM** | Constrained track | Development baseline; substantial parity and lab gates remain |

::: info Two independent solutions
The SCOM Management Pack and Azure Monitor Health Model have separate design, source,
deployment, testing, and release boundaries.

## Why this is separate from Azure Local

Hyper-V and Azure Local share Windows Server virtualization and SCOM concepts, but they do not
have identical product topology or signal sources. Azure Local adds a prescribed, Azure-integrated
platform stack with opinionated storage, lifecycle management, registration, and Azure-side
services. Hyper-V must also account for standalone hosts, general-purpose failover clusters,
optional SCVMM management, and configurations that have no Azure dependency.

Network ATC is **not** an Azure Local-only capability. It is supported for eligible Windows Server
2025 Datacenter failover clusters and is this project's preferred host-networking baseline for such
Hyper-V clusters. When SCVMM or Windows Server SDN participates in network management, the
Management Pack must model its actual layer rather than assume one universal authority. Network
ATC may own host intent while Network Controller owns the overlay. Older or otherwise ineligible
Hyper-V environments still require explicit non-ATC coverage.

The project will reuse stable authoring patterns and shared health semantics while keeping
platform-specific discoveries and monitoring independently supportable.

See the [Hyper-V design map](../design/hyper-v/index.md) for the separate
[SCOM](../design/hyper-v/scom-mp.md) and conditional
[Azure Monitor Health Models](../design/hyper-v/azure-monitor.md) lanes.

## Hyper-V topology research

The research baseline defines the candidate supported matrix for:

- standalone Hyper-V hosts;
- Hyper-V failover clusters;
- hosts and VMs managed by SCVMM;
- Network ATC-managed, manually managed, and SCVMM/SDN-managed host networking;
- virtual switches, adapters, storage, replication, and VM relationships; and
- supported Windows Server, SCOM, and SCVMM versions.

See [Research spikes](../design/research-spikes.md) and the
[Hyper-V SCOM track](scom-mp.md) for the delivery gate.

Phase-one execution is documented in the [Hyper-V SCOM monitoring research](monitoring-research.md)
plan. Its [catalog policy](monitoring-catalog.md) separates the exhaustive raw inventory from the
smaller default monitoring profile.
