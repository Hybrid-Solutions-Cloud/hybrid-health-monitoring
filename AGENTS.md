# hybrid-health-monitoring — Agent instructions

<!--
  AGENTS.md is the canonical, cross-tool instruction file for this repo.
  Codex CLI, Cursor, and VS Code Copilot read it natively; Claude Code
  imports it via CLAUDE.md; Gemini reads it via contextFileName.
  Keep it THIN — it is a bootstrap and an offline fallback, not a full
  standards library. The authoritative source is the HCS Governance MCP.

## What this repo is

Documentation repo for Hybrid Infrastructure Health Monitoring across Hyper-V and Azure Local,
delivered through SCOM and, where supported, Azure Monitor. Its public documentation is published
with VitePress.

<!-- One paragraph. What the repo is, why it exists, and what it is not. -->

## Start here — connect to the HCS Governance MCP

This repo is governed by the **HCS Governance MCP server** (connection details in
[`.ai/mcp/mcp-servers.md`](.ai/mcp/mcp-servers.md)). It is the source of truth for
standards, hard rules, and orchestration guidance.

**At session start, call:**

```text
bootstrap(repo="hybrid-health-monitoring", client="<your client: claude-code | codex | gemini | cursor | vscode>")
```

It returns this repo's scope, the applicable hard rules, the index of applicable
standards, the `.ai/` session protocol, and orchestration guidance shaped for your
client's capability tier. **Prefer a live MCP answer over anything written in this file** —
this file is the offline fallback.

## Offline fallback (when the MCP server is unreachable)

**Standards scope:** `hcs` <!-- hcs | tierpoint-prodtech | azurelocal -->

**Hard rules digest:**

- No secrets, tokens, passwords, subscription/tenant/client IDs, or connection strings in any committed file.
- Scripts and solutions that support PowerShell 7: use PowerShell 7+ — `#Requires -Version 7.0`, `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`, `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`. For SCOM workflows or Cluster/VMM modules that require Windows PowerShell, use their supported runtime; do not treat PS7 incompatibility as a blocker or force an unsupported import. This is the operator's explicit runtime clarification. Never Bash.
- All documentation is Markdown only. Diagrams are draw.io only — commit the `.drawio` XML alongside any exported `.png`.
- Commit format: `type(scope): short description` — types `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test` — with an `AB#<id>` work-item reference.

## Session protocol

1. **Read `.ai/state/` first** — `CURRENT_TASK.md`, then `HANDOFF.md`, then `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
2. Then read `.ai/memory/` for durable context (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `COMMANDS.md`, `GOTCHAS.md`).
3. Summarise your believed state back to the operator before making changes.
4. **Before ending the session, update `.ai/state/HANDOFF.md`** — what changed, files touched, commands run and results, branch, blockers, next steps.

Full contract: the [AI workspace standard](https://platform.hybridsolutions.cloud/standards/ai-workspace/).
