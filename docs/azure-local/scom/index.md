# Azure Local SCOM Management Pack

> **Azure Local / SCOM** — the committed SCOM delivery surface for Azure Local.

This section covers **how the Azure Local design is implemented** as a SCOM Management Pack. Read
the [Azure Local SCOM design lane](../../design/azure-local/scom-mp.md) first. Shared principles do not
make this platform's entity model, signals, or discoveries applicable to the Hyper-V MP.

::: warning Development baseline, not a production release
Five independent MP artifacts, the platform-owned DA, monitoring workflows, operator views,
customer override templates, and offline tests are implemented. Microsoft VSAE/SDK verification,
ordered transient test sealing, and strong-name verification pass for the complete suite against
the installed SCOM 2022 dependencies. Governed release signing and SCOM lab certification are
still required before release.
:::

No Azure Local SCOM package is publicly downloadable yet. This track remains a development and
validation baseline.

Looking for the other SCOM product? See the independent
[Hyper-V SCOM Management Pack](../../hyper-v/scom-mp.md).
